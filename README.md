### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a web programmer who loves open source and its qualities.

I program mainly in JavaScript and Python, although I also use some other languages.

I mainly contribute to small and big projects that I know about.

Yes, this year I hardly contributed anything, although next year I will.
